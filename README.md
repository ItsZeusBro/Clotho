# Clotho
## Clotho is used to prepare, cache, and/or ignore data going into your Hydra Computable, which uses a Moira Machine.

### Moira is considered to be a Machine that is considered to be "invisible zeroware" to your Hydra Context
#### Clotho is responsible for everything related to the Input going into the Computable context. Zeus and Attropos are more interested in obtaining and delivering the result
